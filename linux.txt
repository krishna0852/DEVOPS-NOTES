11,15 co 33 ===it will copy the 11 to 15 lines and it will paste from 33

========================
etc/os-release-> this location has the version details of the system and also flavour name.

cat etc/os_release
=======================

you can write the multiple commands in a single line by diving the each command either ; or && 

eg: ls ; date ; cal 
eg: ls && date && cal
============================================================================================
alias aliasname="cd ~/path;ls"
if you want to remove alias 
unalias aliasname

alias are not permanent ,once system get booted alias will be eraised form the system
if you want to make alias as permanent we need to put this alias name in some file. @@@##doubt

expr 2 + 3 //spaces are mandatory

expr 2 * 3 // it will give an error because astrick is consider as a special character in linux , if you want to perform any operation based on astrick add \ before astrick.. also for other operators as well  

expr 2 \* 3 // 6
=========================

echo is like print function in lilnux .

if you want to create a subdirectory while creating the parent directory you need to pass an argument (-p) with the mkdir command == mkdir -p parent_directory/subdirecotry

===============
https://linuxhandbook.com/cp-command/  --- about the copy command 

cp is used to copy the files or directories

if you are copying the directorties along with the sub-directories then we need to pass the argument -r 

cp source_file target_file

cp -r dir_1 dir_8 ## all the files and sub-directories which are in dir_1 will be copied into the dir_8

mv ===move command 

mv  command is used to rename the file and also to move the file or directory from one location to antother location 

mv file1 dir_1  ====. file_1(file) is moving to dir_1(direcctory)
 
 
 
cat -n ===whn you print the file it will assign the numbers for each line so that we recoginze which line it is. 

tac ---it will print content in reverse fomat from the file 






==================

umask ===> it has a value, based on that the permissions will get assigned for each category user,group,others

read -4   write--2 execute -1


file ---666
directory--777

if you want to change the umask value you can pass the value with the umask command


eg umask 023   it will cahnge globally 



The umask is shell file ===>vi /etc/profile


=====================


if you want to add the user then use    useradd teja =====teja user will be created in homedirectory 


if you want to see the list of users go to /etc/passwd

if you want to create the user in home directory while creating the user ...   useradd -m teja 



links : 1) hard link 
        2) symbolic link or softlink (not recommended)
		
		
For suppose i have created a test file when i try to call the test file first it will goto inode then it goes to the block(hard-disk) from there it will read and display the content.

       Test
	    |
	  inode
	    |
	  Block(disk)
	 

*Inode has unique number.
#when you are creating hardlink both the files should in same device (partion)
  
                     
                file_1 is hardlink with file_2
    file_1  --------------------------------------  file_2
	(sourcefile)                               (destination file) /
	\												  
                                                  /													  
	 \										/
      \                                   /									
	 \ \                               /
       \
	    \- ----INODE --------------- /
		

here file1 is hard link with the file_2 what ever the data in file_1 also will be in file_2 both communicate with the node as well.

if i deleted soucefile the destination file will remain same.
# hardlink can only work for the files but not directories.


symbolic link 

here the symbolic link will not communicate with the inode so when ever you try to delete the souce file the symbolic link will not work.


when you create the symbolic link you shouldn't delete and also not to move the source file from one location to another location if we do any one the symbolic link will not work


ls -li===========>you will get an inode number for each file .


ln file_1 file_2 ----> hard link ------------both file_1 and file_2 has same inode number.

ln -s file_1 file_2 --->symbolic link ---------both file_1 and file_2 has different inode number.


sudo user
===============
when you try to assign the root permissions to the normal user then the noraml user will became a sudo user 

to bacome a sudo user you need to mention that normal user in sudo file  ........visudo 











connecting to the remote server via telent.

                          TELNET
          user -----------------------------------server 
		       password will leak in plan text and it's not encrypted.  
			   
			 
		                  SSh
     		user -------------------------------------server
			
			
when you try to connec to the remoteserver via ssh when you request for connection , the sever will response with a key and it is used for encryption and identification.

when ever you login via ssh ip you will get a prompt ecsdakey fingerprint ,when you give the input as yes it will add those keys in known hosts.
