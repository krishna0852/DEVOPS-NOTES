========================
etc/os-release-> this location has the version details of the system and also flavour name.

cat etc/os_release
=======================

you can write the multiple commands in a single line by diving the each command either ; or && 

eg: ls ; date ; cal 
eg: ls && date && cal
============================================================================================
alias aliasname="cd ~/path;ls"
if you want to remove alias 
unalias aliasname

alias are not permanent ,once system get booted alias will be eraised form the system
if you want to make alias as permanent we need to put this alias name in some file. @@@##doubt
=====================================================================================================================================

expr 2 + 3 //spaces are mandatory

expr 2 * 3 // it will give an error because astrick is consider as a special character in linux , if you want to perform any operation based on astrick add \ before astrick.. also for other operators as well  

expr 2 \* 3 // 6
=========================

echo is like print function in lilnux .

if you want to create a subdirectory while creating the parent directory you need to pass an argument (-p) with the mkdir command == mkdir -p parent_directory/subdirecotry

===============
https://linuxhandbook.com/cp-command/  --- about the copy command 

cp is used to copy the files or directories

if you are copying the directorties along with the sub-directories then we need to pass the argument -r 

cp source_file target_file

cp -r dir_1 dir_8 ## all the files and sub-directories which are in dir_1 will be copied into the dir_8
====================================

=====
https://ostechnix.com/test-your-bash-skills-by-playing-command-line-games/ --- practice .

cp -r
cat -n 

more ---more command is used to view the data page by page also shows the percentage and it's work in forward direction ----nextpage --space bar,   nextline---enter
less-less command is used to view the data page by page and it's works in both forward and backward direction ----nextpage--spacebar, nextline-enter, previous page--uparrow








sort command


sort file_name --it will print the data in aplhabetical order ..original file will not reflect 



sort file-name > sortedfile.txt --we are creating a new file after sorting 

sort -r filename --reversed order 


===
before using uniq command the data should be sorted 

uniq file_Name --list the data without duplicate records 
uniq -d file_name --list the data only with duplicate records 

uniq -c fil_name --it will show the how many types it has repeated 





================




cmp---it will show the difference exactly where the files has 
cmp file fil2


diff file1 file2

< file1 data which is not having at file2
>file2 which is not having at file1


c-change
d-delete
a-add

===============
 comm

used to compare 2 sorted files
it provides output in 3 columns
in first column displays unique in first file
in second column displays unique in second line 
in third column displays displays common lines in 2 files 




input ,output and error direction
==================================

output redirection > >> 1     -----------1 representing the ooutput redirection but optional 
error redirection > >> 2      ----2 mandatory        
input redirection < 0         ---1 optional 


cat 1> output.txt
1
2
3

after ctrl +d rather than displaying it will store in the output.txt

>  -it will override the previous content 
>> it will append the data with the previous content 


tty




=============

piping 
===========

we can pass output of one command as input for next command is called piping


ls -l > output.txt | wc 


* In middle of piping if we use redirection then it breaks piping 



tee
---
ls -l /etc | tee output.txt | wc

it will transfer to output file and ;ater it transfer to wc 


xargs';
========


cat test.sh | xargs rm 

date | xargs echo

=======================



TYPE OF PROCFESSES:




FOREGROUND PROCFESS
BACKGROUND PROCESS USE & AFTER THE COMMAND TO RUN THE BACKGROUND PROCFESS ....SH SCRIPT.SH &


ps -f ---this will shows the process whicha are running by the user 

ps -e-- this will shows all the process running bu the linux and the user as well


pd -ef --it will show all the process running with all the users


ps -H

PS -F -H  --BOTH COMMANDS CLEARLY SHOWS THE PARENT AND CHILD PROCESS


YOU CAN LIS THTE PROCESS USING THE PTOCESS IF 

PS 123
