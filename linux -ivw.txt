A user is not able to ssh to a remote server , what could be the possible cause?

1st:  for pem key file should have permissions 400 if it has other than this permissions it will not able to do.
2nd:we need to ckeck the file:

vim/etc/ssh/sshd_config---it ocntains the port number which the ssh port is running currently
and also shows the address family , Authentication --whether any user is denyed to login 
we can do like this 
DenyUser teja

teja user has no access to ssh 

allowusers teja teja can only access to ssh
need to look public authentication 
also needo check for this folder permissions.
cd /var/empty/--for this folder the permissions should be 711 it other than this we can't ssh



setfacl -m u:username:rwx /tmp/abc===
getfacl /temp/abc---it will displays the permissions
