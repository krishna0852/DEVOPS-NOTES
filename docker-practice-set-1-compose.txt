Create a Dockerfile that installs nginx and exposes port 80.



Build an image from the Dockerfile you created in step 1, using the docker build command.

Run a container from the image you built in step 2, using the docker run command.

Mount a volume from the host machine to a container using the docker run -v command.

Create a network in Docker using the docker network create command.

Run two containers on the same network created in step 5, and have them communicate with each other.

Create a Docker Compose file that defines a multi-container application.

Use Docker Compose to start and stop the containers defined in the Compose file.

Configure environment variables in a Docker Compose file using the env_file and environment directives.

Use Docker Compose to scale a service up and down using the docker-compose up --scale command.

Dockerizing an existing application: Take an existing application that is not running in a Docker container and create a Dockerfile to containerize it.

Creating a multi-stage Docker build: Use a multi-stage Docker build to create a smaller, more efficient Docker image. This involves using multiple Docker images in a single Dockerfile.

Deploying a Dockerized application to a cloud provider: Use a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to deploy your Dockerized application to a production environment.

Creating a Docker volume: Use Docker volumes to persist data between container instances. Create a Docker volume and use it to store data for your application.

Creating a Docker network: Use Docker networks to enable communication between container instances. Create a Docker network and configure your application to use it.

Using Docker Compose to deploy a multi-container application: Use Docker Compose to define and deploy a multi-container application. This can involve using multiple Docker images and coordinating their deployment.

Using Docker Swarm to deploy a multi-node application: Use Docker Swarm to deploy a multi-node application across a cluster of Docker nodes. This involves managing the deployment and scaling of your application across multiple nodes.
