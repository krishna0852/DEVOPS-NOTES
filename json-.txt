{
  "Student": [
      
	{
	    "id":"01",
		"name":"Teja",
		"lastname":"Palla"
	},
	{
	    "id":"02",

JSON PATH :

JSONPath is a query language for JSON, similar to xPath for XML

JSONPath Expressions

paths can use the dot notation 


$.store.book[0].title

inside store there is an array called book and from that we are extracting the data
of title which is belongs to the 0th index.


or bracket notation 

$['store']['book'][0]['title']

$ represents the roor object or array and can be omitted.

[n]==selects the n-th element from an arrayindexes are 0-based 
[index1,index2]==selects array elements with the specified indexes. Returns a list
..property===for suppose you have 5 objects and each object contains the price value
and you want to reterive all the price value of every object use #..price
*==all the objects 
[start:end]
[start:]
[:n]
[-n:]
